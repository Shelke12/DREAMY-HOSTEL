    <h1>wDREAMY HOSTEL </h1>
    <p>
        At Musafir hostel Udaipur, we offer more than an accommodation. We offer quality stay with an unforgettable experience of being together. With comfortable, cozy beddings and soothing atmosphere, our Musafirs get the homelike feeling while travelling.
        The idea was to create a space where people across the globe would unify to share their stories, cultures, experiences and love. As Ibn Battuta quoted, “Travelling leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller”, we want our Musafirs
        to tell their stories and listen to some of ours, while creating new stories to remember. Located in the narrow lanes of Udaipur but in the heart of the city. Having the most amazing and peaceful view, sunset, vibes, stay and more.
